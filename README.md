# network_change_verifications
A tool for pre and post network change verifications, based on Genie/pyATS test cases and jobs. Main use case for this tool is to validate that testbed devices config and operation status is the same as expected before and after a network change but can also be use to [pre]-check that config and operational status are Ok at any point in time.
